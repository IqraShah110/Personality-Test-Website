      <div class="intro-text">
          Why are some people quiet and passive, while others are loud and aggressive? Are certain personality types better adapted than others for certain jobs? Before we can answer these questions, we need to address a more basic one:<strong>What is personality?</strong><br>  Think of personality as the sum of ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others. We most often describe personality in terms of the measurable traits a person exhibits. So, let’s measure our personalities through the <strong>"Big Five Model"</strong>, a personality assessment model that taps five basic dimensions.
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
          <h3>Conscientiousness</h3>
          <p>The conscientiousness dimension is a measure of reliability. A highly conscientious person is responsible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score low on this dimension are easily distracted, disorganized, and unreliable.</p>
         <h3>Conscientiousness at Work:</h3> <p>Personal attributes related to conscientiousness and agreeableness are important for success across many jobs. Highly conscientious people develop higher levels of job knowledge, which correspond with better job performance. They are also more resilient to abusive supervision.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
          <h3>Emotional Stability</h3>
          <p>The emotional stability dimension taps a person’s ability to withstand stress. People with emotional stability tend to be calm, self-confident, and secure. High scorers are generally happier and more optimistic, while low scorers (high neuroticism) may be anxious, depressed, and insecure.</p>
        <h3>Emotional Stability at Work:</h3>
         <p>Emotional stability is strongly related to life satisfaction, job satisfaction, and low stress levels. High emotional stability helps individuals adapt to unexpected workplace demands.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
          <h3>Extraversion</h3>
          <p>The extraversion dimension captures our comfort level with relationships. Extraverts are gregarious, assertive, and sociable. They experience more positive emotions and express them freely, while introverts tend to be more reserved and thoughtful.</p>
          <h3>Extraversion at Work:</h3>
          <p> Extraverts perform better in jobs with significant interpersonal interaction and are strong predictors of leadership emergence. However, they can be more impulsive and may be absent from work more often.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
          <h3>Openness to Experience</h3>
          <p>This dimension addresses the range of interests and fascination with novelty. Open people are creative, curious, and artistically sensitive, while those on the lower end prefer conventional and familiar approaches.</p>
          <h3>Openness at Work:</h3> <p>Open people are more likely to be effective leaders, better at coping with organizational change, and less susceptible to performance decline over time.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
          <h3>Agreeableness</h3>
          <p>The agreeableness dimension refers to an individual’s propensity to defer to others. Agreeable people are cooperative, warm, and trusting, while disagreeable individuals may be cold and antagonistic.</p>
         <h3>Agreeableness at Work:</h3>  <p>Agreeable individuals excel in interpersonally oriented jobs, contribute to organizational citizenship behaviors, and are less likely to engage in counterproductive work behaviors.</p>
